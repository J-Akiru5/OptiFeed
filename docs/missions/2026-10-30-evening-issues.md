# Mission 2026-10-30 (evening): issues #365, #370, #371, #387, #388

Orchestrator: Claude (Sonnet 5.5). Workers: OpenCode `deepseek-v4.1-flash`, one worktree each (`S:\Dev\optifeed\mission-I-xx`), branches from `origin/develop` v1.31.8. Rules: `2026-10-26-autonomous-mission.md`.

## State at 19:30 (verified)

| Branch | Version |
|---|---|
| main (production) | 1.31.5 |
| staging | 1.31.7 |
| develop | 1.31.8 |

No open PRs. Older issues #316-#339 are handled by other sessions in the `iso-*` worktrees; this mission does not touch them.

## Decisions (Jeff, 2026-10-30)

| ID | Decision |
|---|---|
| E30 | #387 Feed Now limit follows the pond/device per-meal ceiling and the remaining daily ceiling. The 1000 g request cap stays only as an absolute hard safety ceiling and is not raised. Errors name the setting and the number. |
| E31 | #388 Device connectivity has three states: Online, Weak signal, Offline. Thresholds are configurable by the superadmin. One late beat must not flip to Offline. If configuration needs a schema change, the worker stops and proposes an additive migration. |
| E32 | #371 A failed Pond Settings save keeps every typed value; errors are inline with a link to the conflicting setting. Where device or org values conflict, the pond setting wins. |
| E33 | #370 Global search indexes settings keys (daily feed ceiling, calibration, capacity, thresholds) and deep-links to the field. |
| E34 | #365 Verify only: no new code. |

## #365 verification (Claude)

Pakoy's full write surface (#344) shipped in v1.31.2 (`5ad31c9`, `5b8a54e`, merged by #357) and is in develop, staging and main. Issue #365 was filed at 01:32 on 30 Oct, when production still ran v1.23.0; main reached v1.31.5 at 12:23. Expected to be resolved on production; Jeff to confirm in the app, then close.

## Tasks

| Task | Issue | Branch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-94 | #387 Feed Now cap = pond setting | `mission/I-94-feed-now-cap` | running |
| I-95 | #388 three connectivity states, superadmin thresholds | `mission/I-95-offline-states` | running |
| I-96 | #371 keep typed values + #370 search settings keys | `mission/I-96-settings-search` | running |

## Integration log

Empty. Workers push branches only; Claude reviews, gates, versions (re-reading `origin/develop` first), opens the PR into develop and closes issues with the version and SHA.
